• Question 1: What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors.

- A CSS selector is a pattern used to select HTML elements that you want to style.

1. Element Selector:

- Targets HTML elements by their tag name.
- It styles all elements of that type.
Example:
p {
  color: blue;
}
- This will make all <p> elements’ text blue.

2. Class Selector:

- Starts with a dot (.).
- Used to style one or more elements that share the same class attribute.

Example:
<p class="highlight">This is highlighted text.</p>
<style>
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: black;
}
</style>

3. ID Selector:

- Starts with a hash symbol (#).
- Used to style a specific, unique element (each ID should be used only once per page).

Example:
<p id="main">This is the main paragraph.</p>
<style>
#main {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: red;
}
</style>



• Question 2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesget resolved?

- CSS specificity is a set of rules that the browser uses to decide which CSS style to apply when multiple selectors target the same element.

Priority (Highest → Lowest)	         Example
1 Inline styles	                  <p style="color:red;">
2 ID selectors	                  #intro {}
3 Class, attribute, pseudo-class	.highlight {}
4 Element selectors	              p {}
5 Universal/inherited styles	    * {}



• Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

- CSS can be added to a webpage in three main ways — inline, internal, and external.
Each has its own use cases, benefits, and drawbacks.

1. Inline CSS:

- CSS is written inside an HTML tag using the style attribute.
Example:
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is inline CSS.</p>

Advantages:
- Quick and easy for small changes or testing.
- Styles apply immediately to that element only.
- No need for an external file.

Disadvantages:
- Not reusable (you must repeat styles on every element).
- Makes HTML code messy and hard to maintain.
- Has highest specificity, so can override other styles unintentionally.
- Slower for large projects (lots of repeated code).

2. Internal CSS:

- CSS is written inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of an HTML file.

Example:
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is internal CSS.</p>
</body>

Advantages:
- Keeps styles in one place within the same HTML file.
- Easier to maintain than inline CSS.
- Good for small projects or single-page designs.

Disadvantages:
- CSS applies only to that page.
- For multiple pages, you must copy styles into each file.
- Increases page size and load time if used repeatedly.



3. External CSS:

- CSS is written in a separate .css file, linked to the HTML using the <link> tag.

Example:
 HTML file:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

style.css file: 
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 18px;
}

Advantages:
- Best for large websites — one CSS file can style many pages.
- Makes code clean and organized.
- Browser caches CSS, improving load time after the first visit.
- Easy to maintain and update.

Disadvantages:
- Requires an extra HTTP request (may slightly delay initial load).
- If the CSS file fails to load, the page loses all styling.
