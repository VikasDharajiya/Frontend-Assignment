• Question 1: Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

- CSS Grid:

- CSS Grid is a 2-dimensional layout system in CSS.
- It allows you to control layout in both rows and columns at the same time.

- Flexbox:

- Flexbox is a 1-dimensional layout system.
- It aligns items either in a row OR in a column, not both simultaneously.

- Use CSS Grid when:

- You want to design full layouts (e.g., webpage structure: header, sidebar, content, footer)
- You need rows + columns together
- You want items placed at specific positions (e.g., item at row 2, column 3)
- Layout is like a table, but flexible

- Use Flexbox when:
- You only need a single row or column layout
- Items move and adjust automatically
- Navigation bars, buttons, cards, aligning small elements



• Question 2: Describe the grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap properties. Provide examples of how to use them.

- 1. grid-template-columns :

-Defines the number of columns and their widths.

Example:
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 2fr;
}

Meaning:
1st column: 200px
2nd column: flexible (1 part)
3rd column: bigger flexible (2 parts)

- 2. grid-template-rows:

- Defines row heights.

Example:
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px auto 50px;
}

Meaning:
Row 1: 100px
Row 2: auto (takes remaining space)
Row 3: 50px

- 3. grid-gap (or just gap):

- Adds space between grid items.

Example:
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}

Meaning:
3 equal columns
20px space between all items
