• Question 1: What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design?

- Media queries are CSS rules that apply styles only when certain conditions are true, such as screen width, height, device type, orientation, etc.

Example conditions:
Screen width < 600px
Screen width > 1024px
Screen is in landscape mode
Device is a phone or tablet

- Media queries help you make your website responsive, meaning the layout adjusts to:

Mobile screens
Tablets
Laptops
Large desktops

- Without media queries, your website would look the same on every device, causing:

Text too large or small
Layout breaking
Images overflowing
Poor user experience



• Question 2: Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens smaller than 600px

(default font-size)
body {
  font-size: 18px;
}

(small than 600px)
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
