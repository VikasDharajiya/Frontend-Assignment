• Question 1: Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Whymight
you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

- Web-safe fonts:

- These are fonts that are already installed on most operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).
- They do not need to be downloaded.
- Examples: Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Georgia, Courier New.

- Custom web fonts:

- These are fonts that are not preinstalled on all devices.
- They must be downloaded from the web when the webpage loads.
- Examples: Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, custom .ttf/.woff files.

- You might choose a web-safe font because:

- Faster loading — no need to download anything.
- Better performance on slow connections.
- More reliable — will look almost the same on every device.
- No external server dependency — website works even if Google Fonts or external links fail.



• Question 2: What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom GoogleFont
to a webpage?

- It is a CSS property used to set the font for text in HTML elements.

- It can contain:

A specific font → "Poppins"
A fallback font → Arial
A generic type → sans-serif

ex: 

body {
  font-family: "Poppins", Arial, sans-serif;
}

- How to apply a Google Font to a webpage:

Step 1: Get the Google Font link:

- Go to fonts.google.com, choose a font, and Google provides a <link> tag.

Example (Poppins):
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

- Put this inside the <head> of your HTML.

- Step 2: Use the font with font-family

body {
  font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
}
