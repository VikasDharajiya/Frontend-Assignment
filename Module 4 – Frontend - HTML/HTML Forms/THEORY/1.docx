• Question 1: What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea,
select, and button elements.

- HTML forms are used to collect user input on a web page and send it to a server for processing.
- They allow users to enter data such as text, passwords, email addresses, or choices, which can then be submitted (e.g., for login, registration, or feedback).

Purpose of Common Form Elements:

1. <input> element:
- Used to take single-line user input such as text, numbers, email, passwords, etc.
- It has different types (like text, email, password, radio, checkbox, file, etc.) depending on what kind of data is expected.
Example:
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
<input type="password" placeholder="Enter password">

2. <textarea> element:
- Used for multi-line text input, such as comments or feedback.
- Unlike <input>, it allows users to type large amounts of text.
Example:
<textarea rows="4" cols="30" placeholder="Enter your message"></textarea>

3. <select> element:

- Used to create a drop-down list from which users can select one (or multiple) options.
- Contains <option> elements that represent each choice.
Example:
<select>
  <option value="html">HTML</option>
  <option value="css">CSS</option>
  <option value="js">JavaScript</option>
</select>

4. <button> element:
- Used to trigger an action when clicked — typically to submit a form or reset input fields.
Example:
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
<button type="reset">Reset</button>



• Question 2: Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used?

- When submitting an HTML form, data can be sent to the server using either the GET or POST method.
- Both methods define how the browser sends data to the server.

1. GET :
- The data is visible in the URL.
- It has a data length limit (usually around 2048 characters).
- It is not secure for sensitive information (like passwords).
- It is faster and can be bookmarked or shared.

2. POST :
- The POST method sends form data in the HTTP request body, not visible in the URL.
- There is no size limit for the data.
- It is more secure than GET because data is hidden from the URL.
- It is used for submitting or updating information on the server.



• Question 3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve
accessibility?

- The <label> element is used to describe or name an input field in a form.
Example:
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">

How <label> Improves Accessibility:

- Connects text to input fields – Helps users understand what each field means.
- Screen readers can read labels aloud, making forms accessible for visually impaired users.
- Clickable labels – Clicking on the label focuses or activates the related input field, improving usability.
- Improves form clarity and navigation, especially for users with disabilities.
