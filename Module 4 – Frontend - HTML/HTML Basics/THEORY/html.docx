• Question 1: Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure   web pages. It defines the content and layout of a webpage using elements called tags (like <p>, <h1>, <img>, etc.).

- Purpose of HTML in Web Development:

- Structure: It provides the basic structure of a webpage — headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, etc.
- Content Presentation: It organizes text, images, and other media for display in web browsers.
- Linking Documents: It allows linking between different web pages using hyperlinks (<a> tag).
- Foundation for Other Technologies: It works with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build complete, dynamic websites.



• Question 2: Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tags and their purposes

- Every HTML document follows a specific structure that helps the browser understand how to display the content.

- Here’s the basic structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

- <!DOCTYPE html>	: Declares the document type and version of HTML. It tells the browser that the page is written in HTML5.
- <html> : The root element of an HTML document. All other elements are placed inside it.
- <head> : Contains metadata (information about the document) such as the title, character encoding, styles, and links to scripts or CSS files. This content is not shown on the page.
- <title> : Defines the title of the web page, which appears on the browser tab.
- <body> : Contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, videos, links, etc.



• Question 3: What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
HTML? Provide examples of each.

- Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretching from left to right).They are used to create large structural sections of a webpage.

Features:
- Always start on a new line.
- Occupy the full width of their parent container.
- Can contain other block-level or inline elements.

- ex:
<div>Division Block</div>
<p>Paragraph Block</p>
<h1>Heading</h1>
<ul>
  <li>List Item</li>
</ul>
- Common Block Elements:
<div>, <p>, <h1>–<h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <section>, <article>

- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
They are used to style or format small portions of text inside a block-level element.

Features:
- Do not break the line.
- Occupy only the space required by their content.
- Usually used inside block-level elements.

- ex:
<span>Inline text</span>
<a href="#">Link</a>
<strong>Bold text</strong>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example">
- Common Inline Elements:
<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <b>, <i>, <u>



• Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility andSEO? Provide examples of semantic elements.

- Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning and purpose in the webpage — both for humans and browsers.
- Instead of using generic tags like <div> or <span>, semantic HTML uses tags that tell what kind of content they contain.

- Role of Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML helps:

- Organize content meaningfully — making the webpage structure clear and easy to understand.
- Improve accessibility — screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret and navigate the content.
- Enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization) — search engines can understand the page structure and rank it more effectively.

Importance for Accessibility:

- Screen readers can identify sections like headers, navigation, main content, and footers.
- Helps visually impaired users navigate the page easily.
Example:
<nav>Navigation Links</nav>
<main>Main Content Here</main>
<footer>Page Footer</footer>

Importance for SEO:

- Search engines like Google use semantic tags to understand what each section of your webpage means.
- For example, <article> tells Google that the content is an independent article, and <header> marks the top section.
- This improves your page’s ranking and visibility in search results.
