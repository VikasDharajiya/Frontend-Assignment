Question 1: Structure of an HTML Table and Purpose of Elements

- An HTML table is used to display data in a structured, grid-like format (rows and columns). The basic elements of a table include:

1. <table>:
- This is the container element that defines the start and end of a table.
2. <tr> (Table Row):
- Represents a row in the table. Every row contains cells (<th> or <td>).
3. <th> (Table Header):
- Represents a header cell, usually bold and centered by default.
- Used to describe the content of a column or row.
4. <td> (Table Data):
- Represents a data cell, containing the actual content of the table.
5. <thead> (Table Head):
- Groups header rows together. Usually used to separate the header from the body (<tbody>) and can help with styling or scrolling.



Question 2: Difference Between colspan and rowspan

- colspan: Merges multiple columns into a single cell.

Example:
<tr>
  <td colspan="2">This cell spans 2 columns</td>
</tr>

- rowspan: Merges multiple rows into a single cell.

Example:
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">This cell spans 2 rows</td>
  <td>Row 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Row 2</td>
</tr>

colspan → horizontal merging
rowspan → vertical merging



Question 3: Why Tables Should Be Used Sparingly for Layout

- Using tables for layout is not recommended because:

- Tables are meant for tabular data, not page design.
- Using tables for layout makes the HTML less semantic and harder to maintain.
- It can negatively affect accessibility (screen readers) and SEO.
- Tables can make responsive design difficult.
