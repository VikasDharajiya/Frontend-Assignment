1. What is a Program?

- A Program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer what to do.
- Example: A calculator program adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides numbers when we give input.


2. What is Programming?

- Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) that a computer can understand and execute.
- It involves problem-solving, logic, and creativity to build software.

Key Steps in Programming Process:

- Understanding the problem
- Planning the solution (flowchart/algorithm)
- Writing the code
- Testing and debugging
- Running and maintaining the program


3. Types of Programming Languages?

- High-level languages (Python, Java, C#) → Easy to read, close to human language.
- Low-level languages (Assembly, Machine code) → Closer to hardware, harder to write.


4. World Wide Web & Internet Working

- Client (browser) requests a page.
- Server processes the request and sends back the page.
- Data travels via TCP/IP using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

Client and Server:

- Client = User’s computer or phone (sends request).
- Server = Stores website/software (sends response).
- Communication happens through requests and responses.


LAB EXERCISE: Diagram: Data Transmission (Client ↔ Server)

-    ┌─────────────┐           Request           ┌─────────────┐
   │   Client    │ ─────────────────────────▶ │   Server    │

           └──────────────────────── Response ◀──────┘


5. Network Layers on Client and Server

Function of the TCP/IP Model and Its Layers:

The TCP/IP model explains how data moves between client and server over the internet.
It has 4 layers:

Application Layer:

- Provides services like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP.
- Client: Browser sends HTTP request.
- Server: Web server sends back response (HTML, CSS, JS).

Transport Layer:

- Ensures reliable communication using TCP (or fast comms with UDP).
- Client: Breaks message into smaller segments.
- Server: Reassembles them in correct order.

Internet Layer:

- Handles addressing and routing using IP (Internet Protocol).
- Client: Finds the server’s IP address (via DNS).
- Server: Sends data packets to client’s IP address.

Network Access Layer (Link Layer):

- Deals with actual hardware and transmission.
- Client: Sends packets through Wi-Fi/Ethernet.
- Server: Receives packets via its network interface.


6. Client and Server Communication

What is a Client?
- A client is a device or application that requests services or resources from another computer (server).
- Examples:
Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox)
Mobile apps (Instagram, WhatsApp)

What is a Server?
- A server is a computer or program that provides services or resources to clients.
- Examples:
Web server (Apache, Nginx)
Database server (MySQL, MongoDB)

How Client-Server Communication Works

Communication happens as a request-response cycle:

Client sends a request:
Example: You type www.example.com in a browser.
The browser (client) sends an HTTP request to the server.

Server processes the request:
Checks what the client asked for (webpage, data, file).
Retrieves or generates the response.

Server sends a response back to the client:
Example: Server sends the HTML, CSS, and images of the webpage.

Client displays the response:
The browser renders the webpage for you to see.


7. Types of Internet Connections

- How does Broadband differ from Fiber-Optic Internet?

- Speed: Broadband is moderate (up to hundreds of Mbps), while Fiber-Optic is very high (up to Gbps).

- Technology: Broadband uses copper cables, Fiber uses glass fiber cables with light signals.

- Latency: Broadband has higher latency; Fiber has very low latency.

- Reliability: Broadband is moderate and affected by distance/congestion; Fiber is very reliable and less affected by distance.
Cost: Broadband is moderately priced; Fiber is more expensive but offers much faster speeds.


LAB EXERCISE: Different Types of Internet Connections

Dial-up: 

Pros: Works on regular phone lines, cheap.
Cons: Very slow (up to 56 Kbps), ties up phone line.

DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):

Pros: Uses phone line, always-on connection.
Cons: Slower than fiber, distance from exchange affects speed.

Broadband (Cable):

Pros: Faster than DSL, reliable.
Cons: Shared with neighbors (speed may vary), costs more.

Fiber-Optic:

Pros: Extremely fast, low latency, reliable.
Cons: Expensive, limited availability in rural areas.

Satellite:

Pros: Available almost anywhere, good for remote areas.
Cons: High latency, affected by weather, expensive.

Mobile Data (3G/4G/5G):

Pros: Portable, easy to setup.
Cons: Limited data caps, network coverage issues.

Fixed Wireless:

Pros: Good for rural areas, no cables needed.
Cons: Speed varies, line-of-sight issues.


8. Protocols

Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS:

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):

- Not encrypted.
- Data can be intercepted by attackers.
- Uses port 80.
- Suitable for basic websites without sensitive information.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):

- Encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- Data is secure and cannot be easily intercepted.
- Uses port 443.
- Essential for websites handling sensitive data like banking, login, or e-commerce.

LAB EXERCISE: Simulate HTTP and FTP Requests

You can use command-line tools like curl to simulate requests:

- HTTP Request Example:

curl http://example.com

Sends a simple GET request to a web server.
Displays the HTML content returned by the server.

- FTP Request Example:

curl ftp://ftp.example.com --user username:password

Connects to an FTP server.
Can download or upload files depending on permissions.


9. Application Security

Role of Encryption in Securing Applications:

Encryption converts data into a coded format that can only be read by authorized parties.
Protects sensitive information such as passwords, payment details, and personal data from hackers.
Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and sometimes authentication of data transmitted between clients and servers.
Common encryption methods include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (asymmetric encryption).
In web applications, encryption is used in HTTPS to secure communication between browsers and servers.

Difference Between System Software and Application Software:

System Software:

Manages and controls the computer hardware and provides a platform for running application software.
Examples: Operating systems (Windows, Linux), device drivers, utility programs.
Runs in the background and is essential for the computer to function.

Application Software:

Designed for end-users to perform specific tasks or solve problems.
Examples: MS Word, Excel, Chrome, WhatsApp.
Requires system software to run and provides functionality directly to the user.


10. Software Architecture

Significance of Modularity in Software Architecture:

Modularity is the design principle of dividing a software system into smaller, independent, and reusable components or modules.

Each module focuses on a specific functionality and can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

Advantages of Modularity:

11. Layers in Software Architecture

Importance of Layers in Software Architecture:

Separation of Concerns: Each layer handles a specific function, making the system easier to manage.
Maintainability: Changes in one layer (e.g., database changes) do not affect other layers (e.g., UI).
Scalability: Layers can be modified or upgraded independently to handle more users or data.
Reusability: Business logic and data access layers can be reused in different applications.
Improved Collaboration: Different teams can work on separate layers simultaneously.
