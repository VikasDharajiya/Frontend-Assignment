ðŸ”¹ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is not just a straight line â€” itâ€™s a cycle because after the last step (Maintenance), the process often goes back to the first step (Requirement). Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called a life cycle.

ðŸŒ€ Steps in the Cycle:

Requirement:

Collect information from clients or stakeholders.
Example: A client wants an e-commerce website.

Planning:

Estimate cost, time, resources, and risks.
Example: Decide which tech stack (React, Node.js, Database) and team members are needed.

Design:

Create system design and user interface.
Example: Make wireframes, database schema, and architecture.

Development:

Write the actual code.
Example: Developers build the front-end (UI) and back-end (server logic).

Testing:

Check for bugs, performance, and security.
Example: Test checkout process, login system, and speed of the site.

Deployment:

Release the software to users.
Example: Upload the website to a hosting server (like AWS or Hostinger).

Maintenance:

Fix errors, add new features, keep the system updated.
Example: Update payment gateway, fix security bugs.
