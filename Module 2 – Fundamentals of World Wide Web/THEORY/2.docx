1. Difference between Web Designer and Web Developer

Web Designer:
- Focuses on the look and feel of a website.
- Works with colors, layouts, images, typography, and user experience (UI/UX).
- Uses tools like Figma, Photoshop, Canva, or CSS.

Web Developer:
- Focuses on building and coding the website.
- Writes code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.) to make the site functional.
