1. What is a HTTP?

- HTTP stand for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
- It is the communication protocol used by web browsers and servers to transfer data over the internet.
- Example: When you type a website link like http://example.com, HTTP tells your browser how to fetch the page from the server.


2. What is a Browsers? How they works?

- A Browser is software (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) used to access and view websites.

How it works:

(a) You type a website address (URL).
(b) The browser sends a request (using HTTP/HTTPS) to the web server.
(c) he server sends back the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
(d) The browser interprets these files and displays the page to you.


3. What is a Domain Name?

- A Domain Name is the human-friendly name of a website.
- Example: google.com is easier to remember than its IP address 142.250.190.14.
- It works like an address for your website so users can find it easily.


4. What is Hosting?

- Hosting is a service that stores your website’s files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) on a server so people can access it online.
- When someone enters your domain name, hosting servers deliver the website content to their browser.
- Example: Companies like Hostinger, GoDaddy, or AWS provide hosting services.
